👋 Hi, I’m @KeffyGebre
I discovered my enthusiams for NLP and data science after completing my MPhil degree in Linguistics and working in education/IT roles over the last few years in three different instititions, focusing on Education and Language technology.
My education and diverse work experiences have offered me the skills to approach NLP and data science problems from an interdisciplinary perspective and find unorthodox solutions to them.

My NLP Projects largely focus on in the areas of:
Machine Learning playing with Data Analytics, Database Design and Implementation Programming Languages Used Python, R and NLTK.

💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating on projects that help promote language education, NLP, documentation, and revitalization.
📫 I am reachable via my email address on github and other socialmedia platforms.
